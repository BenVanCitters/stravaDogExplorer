# Strava Dog Explorer
Simple app I made connecting strava activities on to a mapbox map.

This sketch is made to visualize all of my recent walks with my dog so I can avoid taking the same route too often.

To make this sketch there is a strava app which makes the activites available on a athlete by athlete basis.  The flask python app pulls that data down and pushes it on to a mapbox map via geojson layers.
